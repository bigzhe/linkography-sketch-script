SVG.toDataURL()
===============

The missing `SVG.toDataURL()` for your SVG elements. Supports exporting as SVG+XML and PNG.

See [original paper][svgopen2010] for more information on interfacing between SVG and Canvas.

Instructions
------------

1. Include [canvg] if you need PNG support for unsupported browers (see compatibility below).
2. `<script type="text/javascript" src="svg_todataurl.js"></script>`
3. See `butterfly_test.html` for full example & compability test.

```javascript
mySVGelement.toDataURL("image/png", {
    callback: function(data) {
        myIMGelement.setAttribute("src", data)
    }
})
```

API documentation inside [svg_todataurl.js](svg_todataurl.js).

Compatibility
-------------

Test your browser with our [butterfly test suite](http://sampumon.github.io/SVG.toDataURL/butterfly_test.html).

Works in all modern browsers. Some browsers require [canvg] for PNG exporting.

Compatibility as of May 2014. `+` yes, `vv+` yes since version vv, `-` no support yet.

Notes
-----

* SVG `<image>` elements only work if their `src` is a dataURL. External images, same domain or not, will not be rendered (but won't cause a security exception either).
